Limitations
-----------

AsmTool programs only run on X86 processors using
the Linux kernel version 2.4 or later.  It isn't
portable to other UNIX flavors but over 90 percent
of all UNIX installations are for Linux X86.

Most AsmTools runs in a console and terminal.  When
run in the console, only keyboard commands are
available. The console/terminal programs are
built using asmlib.

AsmTools that require a x server are:
  asmbug - debugger
  tracex - trace x server communication
  xhelper - automate desktop programss
  asmlibx - library needed to build asmbug
            and xhelper


Features
--------

Many of the AsmTool programs are described within
AsmRef and that may be a good place to begin.  Each
program also has some additional documentation in
the source files.

When programs are installed as a .deb or .rpm look
for documentation at:

  /usr/share/doc/asmref
  /usr/share/doc/(name of package)
  man (name of package)
